<h2>Preface.</h2>


<p>For some years the Author has been interested in the history
of our First Flag and its fair maker, Betsy Ross, and fortunately,
through a family relationship with one of the descendants, became
familiar with much of the family history.</p>

<p>It seemed that so beautiful and estimable a lady, and one
who played so important a part in those stirring events of our
early history should be better known and appreciated by her
sisters of to-day.</p>

<p>Fitting, it seems, that while man in defending our Flag has
accomplished his greatest achievements, and won undying fame,
woman first fashioned into “a thing of beauty” the symbol of that
patriotic devotion.</p>

<p>To Mr. George Canby of Philadelphia, and Mrs. Sophia Campion
Guthrie of Washington, D. C., grandson and great granddaughter,
respectively, of Betsy Ross, the author is indebted for
family history that has inspired this work, and to them and other
descendants, this book is affectionately dedicated by</p>

<h2>The Story of Our Flag.<br />

<small>COLONIAL AND NATIONAL.</small></h2>


<p>The history of our flag from its inception, in fact, the inception
itself, has been a source of much argument and great
diversity of opinion. Many theories and mystifications have gone
forth, mingled with a few facts, giving just enough color of truth
to make them seem plausible. It is for the purpose of clearing
away the veil of doubt that hangs around the origin of the Stars
and Stripes that this book has been written.</p>

<p>The Continental Congress in 1775 was very much disturbed
over the embarrassing situation of the colonies, and after Washington
was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army, it
showed its independence by appointing a committee composed of
Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Harrison and Mr. Lynch to create
a colonial flag that would be national in its tendency. They finally
decided on one with thirteen bars, alternate red and white, the
“King’s Colors” with the crosses of St. Andrew and St. George
in a field of blue. The cross of St. Andrew then, as now, was of
white, while the cross of St. George was of red. The colonies
still acknowledged the sovereignty of England—as this flag attested—but
united against her tyranny. This was known as the
“flag of our union”—that is, the union of the colonies, and was
not created until after the committee had been to the camp at
Cambridge and consulted with Washington. It was probably
made either at the camp at Cambridge or in Boston, as it was
unfurled by Washington under the Charter Oak on January 2,
1776. It received thirteen cheers and a salute of thirteen guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not known whether Samuel Adams, the “Father of Liberty,”
was consulted in regard to this flag, but it is a well known
fact that he was looking forward, even then, to the independence
of the colonies, while Washington, Franklin and the others still
looked for justice,—tardy though it might be,—from England.</p>

<p>Two days later, on the 4th of January, 1776, Washington
received the King’s speech, and as it happened to come so near
to the time of the adoption of the new flag, with the English
crosses of St. Andrew and St. George, many of the regulars
thought it meant submission, and the English seemed for the
time to so understand it; but our army showed great indignation
over the King’s speech to parliament, and burned all of the copies.</p>

<p>In a letter of General Washington to Joseph Reed, written
January 4, he says: “We are at length favored with the sight of
his majesty’s most gracious speech, breathing sentiments of tenderness
and compassion for his deluded American subjects. The
speech I send you (a volume of them were sent out by the Boston
gentry) was farcical enough and gave great joy to them without
knowing or intending it, for on that day (the 2nd) which gave
being to our new army, but before the proclamation came to
hand, we hoisted the Union flag, in compliment to the United
Colonies, but behold it was received at Boston as a token of the
deep impression the speech had made upon us and as a signal of
submission. By this time I presume they begin to think it
strange that we have not made a formal surrender of our lines.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/i-007.jpg" width="540" height="409" alt="diagram" />
</div>

<p>At this time the number and kinds of flags that were in use
on land and sea, were only limited to the ingenuity of the state
and military officials. This was very embarrassing. On May
20, 1776, Washington was requested to appear before Congress
on important secret military business. Major-General Putnam,
according to Washington’s letters, was left in command at New
York during his absence. It was in the latter part of May, 1776,
that Washington, accompanied by Colonel George Ross, a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of his staff, and by the Honorable Robert Morris, the great
financier of the revolution, called upon Mrs. Betsy Ross, a niece
of Colonel Ross. She was a young and beautiful widow, only
twenty-four years of age, and known to be expert at needle work.
They called to engage her services in preparing our first starry
flag. She lived in a little house in Arch street, Philadelphia,
which stands to-day unchanged, with the exception of one large
window, which has been placed in the front. It was here, in
this house, that Washington unfolded a paper on which had been
rudely sketched a plan of a flag of thirteen stripes, with a blue
field dotted with thirteen stars. They talked over the plan of
this flag in detail, and Mrs. Ross noticed that the stars which
were sketched were six-pointed, and suggested that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
have five points. Washington admitted that she was correct, but
he preferred a star that would not be an exact copy of that on
his coat of arms, and he also thought that a six-pointed star
would be easier to cut. Mrs. Ross liked the five-pointed star, and
to show that they were easily cut she deftly folded a piece of
paper and with one clip of her scissors unfolded a perfect star
with five points. (See illustration showing the way Betsy Ross
folded the paper giving the five-pointed star which has ever since
graced our country’s banner. A, first fold of a square piece of
paper; B, second; C, third, and D, fourth fold. The dotted line
AA is the clip of the scissors.)</p>

<p>There is no record that Congress took any action on the national
colors at this session,—but this first flag was made by
Betsy Ross at this time, and in this way, and we find in Washington’s
letter of May 28, 1776, to General Putnam at New York,
positive instructions “to the several colonels to hurry to get their
colors done.” In the orderly book, May 31, 1776, are these
words: “General Washington has written to General Putnam
desiring him in the most pressing terms, to give positive orders to
all the colonels to have colors immediately completed for their
respective regiments.” The proof is positive that the committee
approved the finished flag of Betsy Ross, and she was instructed
to procure all the bunting possible in Philadelphia and make flags
for the use of congress, Colonel Ross furnishing the money.</p>

<p>It is easily understood how on account of the meager resources
of Congress and the unsettled condition of affairs generally,
together with the fact that legislative action was extremely
slow and tedious, that Colonel Ross should expedite matters by
defraying the expense of this first order for our national colors.
There is little, if any, doubt but that Washington on December
24th, Christmas Eve, in 1776, carried the starry flag in making
that perilous trip through ice and snow across the Delaware,
leading his sturdy, but poorly equipped troops. How inspiring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
look back to that night when the Massachusetts fishermen so
skilfully managed the boats that the whole army was safely landed
and in line of march at four o’clock on Christmas morning. The
story of how they plodded on through ice and snow, surprising
and defeating the Hessians and capturing a thousand men and
their ammunition and equipments, is well known. This was the
battle of Trenton, which changed the whole aspect of the war,
even causing Lord Cornwallis to disembark and again start in
pursuit of Washington, whose cause he had so lately declared
lost. It is fitting here to speak of that friend of Washington,
Robert Morris, one of the committee that originated our national
colors, the great patriot who after the battle of Trenton went
from house to house, soliciting money from his friends to clothe
and feed this glorious army, which had fought so well.</p>

<p>Congress was very slow to act, and did not seem able to
command even the meager resources of the different colonies.
It lacked the centralized government which gives it such strength
to-day. Considering the grave questions affecting the life and
liberty of the people, it is not strange that the flag or any definite
action regarding it, was not given prompt consideration. To
indicate how slow Congress was to act in regard to the flag,
we have only to refer to the Congressional records, which show
that the resolution for its adoption was dated over one year after
it was actually created, by the committee of which Washington
was chief; that is on June 14, 1777. However, a month previous
to this, Congress sent Betsy Ross an order on the treasury for
£14, 12s. 2d., for flags for the fleet in the Delaware River, and
she soon received an order to make all the government flags.
The first flag was made of English bunting, exactly the same as
those of to-day, excepting that our bunting now is of home manufacture.</p>

<p>There seems to be no question but that these colors, the
stars and stripes, were unofficially adopted immediately after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
completion of the first flag, the latter part of May, 1776, and that
they went into general use at once, so far as it was practicable
under the conditions then existing. Washington had the first
flag created at this time. It was satisfactory, and he immediately
instructed General Putnam to have the colonels prepare their
colors—the colors that had just been approved, and which we
know to be our flag of to-day.</p>

<p>The first reference we have of an English description of our
flag is at the surrender of General Burgoyne, October 17, 1777,
when one of the officers said: “The stars of the new flag represent
a constellation of states.”</p>

<p>Mr. George Canby, an estimable gentleman of the old
school, and a grandson of Betsy Ross, has been tireless and indefatigable
in his researches on the subject of our flag, and he
claims, as did his brother, Mr. William J. Canby, before him, that
the first flag with stars and stripes went into immediate use after
its inception in the latter part of May, 1776.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on
July 4, 1776, and some authorities, of whom Admiral Preble is
the best, seem to infer that the Cambridge flag, with its English
crosses, which was unfurled by Washington under the Charter
Oak, was still carried by our armies until Congress took action
in 1777. That Washington or Congress would sanction the carrying
of this flag after the Declaration of Independence seems absurd,
and it is certainly against all proof, as well as against the
records of the family whose ancestor made the first flag.</p>

<p>Peak’s portrait of Washington at the battle of Trenton, December
26 and 27, 1776, shows the Union Jack with the thirteen
stars in the field of blue. Admiral Preble says, this is “only
presumptive proof” that the stars were at that time in use on
our flag, but Titian R. Peale, son of the painter, says: “I visited
the Smithsonian Institute to see the portrait of Washington
painted by my father after the battle of Trenton. The flag represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
has a blue field with white stars arranged in a circle. I
don’t know that I ever heard my father speak of that flag, but the
trophies at Washington’s feet I know he painted from the flags
then captured, and which were left with him for the purpose.”
He further says: “He was always very particular in the matters
of historic record in his pictures.”</p>

<p>This Preble admits in his book, but evidently thought that the
artist, Peale, took the flag as it was then (1779), and not the
flag of 1776, which the writer claims was identically the same.
Through persistent research many facts have come to light that
would doubtless have changed the opinion of the late Admiral
Preble—facts that were unknown to him.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 14, 1777, Congress finally officially
adopted the flag of our Union and independence, to-wit:</p>

<p>Resolved, “That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen
stars, white in the blue field, representing a new constellation.”</p>

<p>There is not the slightest record in any of the mss. journals in
the library of Congress, or in the original files or in the drafts in
motions made in the continental Congress of any previous legislative
action for the establishment of a national flag for the United
States of America, whose independence was declared nearly a
year previous. Even after the official adoption of the flag it was
not thoroughly brought before the people for many months. All
of this adds to the proof that Congress was simply adopting and
legalizing a flag that was in general use. That there was no recorded
discussion in Congress regarding the adoption of our flag,
was perfectly natural, because the star spangled banner came in
with our independence, and at this time (June 14, 1777) was simply
being officially acknowledged.</p>

<p>There is some diversity of opinion as to how the red, white
and blue arranged in the stars and stripes came to be thought of
as our flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The flag of the Netherlands, which is of red, white and blue
stripes, had been familiar to the pilgrims while they lived in Holland,
and its three stripes of red, white and blue were doubtless
not forgotten. But it seems most probable that the coat of arms
of the Washington family furnished more than a suggestion. The
coat of arms of his ancestors, that had been adopted by him,
comprised the red, white and blue and the stars; and was familiar
to all who were associated with Washington. He it was who
brought the pencil drawing, when, with the others, he called upon
Mrs. Ross to have a suitable flag made, and as we find no mention
in history, records or diaries as to who made the drawing, it seems
conclusive that he himself designed and drew the plan from his
own coat of arms, which was entirely different from England’s
colors which had become necessarily distasteful.</p>

<p>It seems fitting in this place to write a little history in regard
to the Washington coat of arms, the earliest mention of which
was by Lawrence Washington, worshipful mayor of Northampton,
England, in 1532. In 1540 he placed it upon the porch of his
manor house, and on the tomb of Ann, his wife, in 1564. At
the old church at Brighton, England, the tombs of Washington’s
ancestors are marked by memorial plates of brass bearing the
arms of the family, which consisted of a shield that bore the
stars and stripes. The Archeological Society of England, the
highest authority on ancient churches and heraldic matters, states
that from the red and white bars, and stars of this shield, and the
raven issuant from its crest (borne later by General Washington),
the framers of the constitution took their idea of the flag.</p>

<p>When General Washington’s great-grandfather, Sir John
Washington, came to this country in 1657, the family shield was
brought with him. Sir John settled in Virginia, and established
the American line of Washingtons. George Washington afterwards
had it emblazoned upon the panels of his carriages, on his
watch seals, book marks, and his dishes also bore the same
emblem.</p>

<p>After the admission of Vermont and Kentucky into the Union,
Congress passed an act in 1794, increasing both the stars and
stripes from thirteen to fifteen, to take effect May, 1795. It was
as follows:</p>

<p>“An act making alterations in the flag of the United States.
Be it enacted, etc., That from and after the first day of May,
one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-five, the flag of the
United States be fifteen stripes, alternate red and white, and that
the union be fifteen stars, white in a blue field.</p>

<p>“Approved January 13, 1794.”</p>

<p>This flag was used for several years. It flew at the mastheads
of our gallant ships and was carried by our little army in the war
with England in 1812. A few years later Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana
and Indiana, now won to civilization by hardy pioneers,
clamored for admittance into the Union. When they were finally
admitted as states, another change in the flag became necessary.
The sturdy young republic was advancing by leaps and bounds in
civilization and wealth; its hardy sons pushing further west and
south constantly, reclaiming from wild savages, to the uses of
their own race, greater and larger areas, which were bound to
be erected into states and take their places in the family of the
original thirteen. It became manifest that legislation was necessary,
permanently defining the national flag, and providing for
such changes as the future development of the country would require.
Congress rose to the occasion. A committee, with Hon.
Peter Wendover of New York as chairman, was appointed to
frame a law, and with very little delay the committee reported
a measure fulfilling every requirement then existing, and providing
for all the future. The measure was passed by congress and
went on the statute books as the law establishing the flag as our
great-grandfathers of that day knew it, and as we know it to-day.
The law has never been changed, and here it is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“An act to establish the flag of the United States.</p>

<p>“Section 1. Be it enacted, etc., That from and after the fourth
day of July next, the flag of the United States be thirteen horizontal
stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union have
twenty stars, white in the blue field.</p>

<p>“Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That on the admission of
every new state into the Union, one star be added to the union of
the flag, and that such addition shall take effect on the fourth of
July next succeeding such admission. Approved April 4, 1818.”</p>

<p>The thirteen stripes will always represent the number of the
“old thirteen” whose patriotism and love of justice brought about
the independence of America. The stars that come into the blue
sky of the flag will mark or indicate the increase of the states
since the adoption of the Constitution. It is interesting to note
that under the stars and stripes Washington, in 1793, laid the
corner stone of the capitol of the United States, first having personally
selected the site of the building. It is also interesting to
know that Washington did not live to see the capitol completed,
but died before the seat of government was moved to Washington
in 1800. The main capitol building was not completed till
1811. It is also a matter of historical interest that the president’s
home, now called the White House, was completed during the
life of Washington, and it is an authenticated fact that he and
his wife inspected the house in all its parts only a few days before
his death. The president’s house was practically destroyed
by the British in 1814; the walls alone remained intact, but the
stone was so discolored that when the building was reconstructed,
it had to be painted, and from this came the name of the “White
House.”</p>

<p>The large picture of Washington, by Stewart, which is now in
the east room, at the time of the bombardment by the British,
was taken out of its frame by Mrs. Dolly Madison, wife of the
president, and sent to a secure place across the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>This flag of forty-five stars, this flag of our country, is our
inspiration. It kindles in our hearts patriotic feelings, it carries
our thoughts and our minds forward in the cause of liberty and
right. On sea and on land, wherever the star spangled banner
waves, it thrills the heart of every true American with pride. It
recalls the memories of battles bravely fought. It recalls the victories
of Trenton and Princeton, it recalls the victories of Gettysburg
and Appomattox. We see the flag as first carried by Paul
Jones across the sea; we see the flag as carried by Commodore
Perry on Lake Erie; we see the flag as carried by Farragut at
New Orleans; we see Admiral Dewey through smoke and fire
hoisting the flag in the Philippines. This same flag was carried
to victory by Admirals Sampson and Schley in Cuba. This flag
recalls the many battles bravely fought and grandly won. It
symbolizes the principles of human progress and human liberty.
The stars represent the unity and harmony of our states. They
are the constellation of our country. Their luster reflects to
every nation of the world. The flag of 1776, the old thirteen,
has grown to be one of the great flags of the earth. Its stars
reach from ocean to ocean. We see it leading the armies of
Washington and Greene, of Grant and Sherman and Sheridan,
and of Miles, Shafter and Merritt.</p>

<p>This is the flag of the “dawn’s early light” that was immortalized
by Francis Scott Key—“The Star Spangled Banner.”</p>

<p>General Grant once said, “No one is great enough to write his
name on the flag.”</p>

<p>A century under the stars and stripes has been the greatest
century of progress in the history of the world. No other nation
that has ever existed has carried forward such a banner. Its
colors were taken from various sources and brought into one
harmonious combination, and it “waves over a country which
unites all nationalities and all races, and in the end brings about
a homogeneous population, representing the highest type of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
civilization.” It is not strange that this flag of Washington, of
Hamilton, of Adams, of Jefferson; this flag of Jackson, of Webster,
of Clay, this flag of Lincoln, of Grant and of McKinley
should exert such world-wide influence. It holds a unique place
in the nations of the world. It has spread knowledge and faith
and hope among all classes. It means liberty with justice. Its
international influence places it in the first rank. It twines itself
among the flags of other nations, not for destruction or war,
but for friendship and progress in the cause of humanity. In
the councils of peace; in the conquests of war; in everything
that pertains to government, in everything that pertains to the
advancement of humanity, it calls forth the admiration of mankind.
Under its influence the arts and sciences have been fostered,
commerce has expanded and education has been made
universal. It waves for the right and the harbors of the globe
will salute this banner as a harbinger of progress and peace.</p>

<p>The youngest nation has the oldest flag.</p>

<p>It is of historical interest that our flag is older than the present
flag of Great Britain, which was adopted in 1801, and it is
nine years older than the flag of Spain, which was adopted in
1785. The French tricolor was decreed in 1794; then comes the
flag of Portugal in 1830; then the Italian tricolor in 1848; then
the flags of the old empires of China and Japan, and of the
empire of Germany, which represents the sovereignty of fourteen
distinct states established in 1870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Prior to the Revolution, and indeed during the evolution of
a nation through the crucible of war, separate and distinct flags
were popular with the colonists. Nearly every colony had at
least one. They were not abandoned until it became apparent the
colonies were never again to be colonies, but to form a nation
with one flag, one set of institutions and laws, a fact which inspired
the visit of Washington to Betsy Ross as told in the
foregoing papers. Many of the colonial flags were interesting.</p>


<h3>GROUP OF COLONIAL FLAGS, NO. 1.</h3>

<p>The two upper flags of this group represent those used at
Bunker Hill July 18, 1775, and bore these inscriptions: On one
side, “An Appeal to Heaven,” and on the other, “Qui Transtulit
Sustinet”—He who transported will sustain.</p>

<p>These were beautiful flags, and research shows that both
colors were used.</p>

<p>Trumbull gives the red in his celebrated painting in the capitol
at Washington, and other authentic accounts show that the blue
flag was carried also—the color being the only difference in the
two.</p>


<h3>THE PINE TREE FLAG.</h3>

<p>The pine tree flag which was a favorite with the officers of the
American privateers, had a white field with a green pine tree in
the middle and bore the motto, “An appeal to heaven.”</p>

<p>This flag was officially endorsed by the Massachusetts council,
which in April, 1776, passed a series of resolutions providing
for the regulation of the sea service, among which was the following:</p>

<p>Resolved, That the uniform of the officers be green and
white, and that they furnish themselves accordingly, and that the
colors be a white flag with a green pine tree and the inscription,
“An appeal to heaven.”—Harper’s Round Table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The striped Continental flag opposite the pine tree flag was of
red and white stripes without a field.</p>


<h3>THE RATTLESNAKE FLAG.</h3>

<p>The device of a rattlesnake was popular among the colonists,
and its origin as an American emblem is a curious feature in
our national history.</p>

<p>It has been stated, that its use grew out of a humorous suggestion
made by a writer in Franklin’s paper—the Pennsylvania
Gazette—that, in return for the wrongs which England was forcing
upon the colonists, a cargo of rattlesnakes should be sent to
the mother country and “distributed in St. James’ Park, Spring
Garden and other places of pleasure.”</p>

<p>Colonel Gadsden, one of the marine committee, presented to
Congress, on the 8th of February, 1776, “an elegant standard,
such as is to be used by the commander-in-chief of the American
navy; being a yellow flag with a representation of a rattlesnake
coiled for attack.”</p>


<h3>WASHINGTON LIFE GUARD FLAG.</h3>

<p>There is probably no more interesting revolutionary flag than
this. The Washington Life Guard was organized in 1776, soon
after the siege of Boston, while the American army was encamped
near New York.</p>

<p>It was said to have been in the museum at Alexandria, Va.,
which was burned soon after the war of the rebellion, and nearly
everything lost. It was of white silk with the design painted
on it.</p>

<p>The uniform of the guard was as follows: blue coat with
white facings, white waistcoat and breeches, with blue half gaiters,
a cocked hat and white plume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GRAND UNION FLAG.</h3>

<p>These were the colors selected by Franklin, Harrison and
Lynch, and unfurled by Washington under the Charter Oak,
January 2, 1776, and hereafter described.</p>

<p>The flag of the Richmond Rifles follows with the one used at
Moultrie.</p>

<p>The latter was of blue with white crescent in the dexter corner
and was used by Colonel Moultrie, September 13, 1775, when he
received orders from the Council of Safety for taking Fort Johnson
on James Island, South Carolina.</p>

<p>In the early years of the Revolution, a number of emblems
were in use which became famous. The standard on the southeast
bastion of Fort Sullivan (or Moultrie, as it was afterward named),
on June 28, 1776, by Colonel Moultrie, was a blue flag with a
white crescent in the upper left hand corner, and the word “Liberty”
in white letters emblazoned upon it.</p>

<p>This was the flag that fell outside the fort and was secured by
Sergeant Jasper, who leaped the parapet, walked the whole length
of the fort, seized the flag, fastened it to a sponge staff and in
sight of the whole British fleet and in the midst of a perfect hail
of bullets planted it firmly upon the bastion. The next day
Governor Rutledge visited the fort and rewarded him by giving
him his sword.</p>

<p>Then comes the flag of White Plains, October 28, 1776, with
little historical importance.</p>

<p>The flag made by Betsy Ross, under the direction of General
Washington, Robert Morris, and Colonel George Ross, consisted
of thirteen bars, alternate red and white, with a circle of thirteen
stars in the field of blue.</p>

<h3>COUNT PULASKI’S FLAG.</h3>

<p>The Moravian sisters of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, gave to
Count Pulaski’s corps, which he had previously organized at
Baltimore and which was called “Pulaski’s Legion,” a beautiful
crimson silk banner, embroidered in yellow silk and sent it with
their blessing. Pulaski was at this time suffering from a wound,
and was on a visit to Lafayette, whose headquarters were at
Bethlehem. Count Pulaski was a Polish patriot, born March 4,
1747. After having bravely fought for Poland with his father
and brothers until the Polish cause became hopeless, he came to
America, arriving in Philadelphia in 1777. He entered the army
as a volunteer, but performing such brave service at Brandywine,
he was promoted to the command of cavalry with rank of brigadier-general.
In 1778 Congress gave him leave to raise a body of
men under his own command. Longfellow has most beautifully
described the presentation of the flag in verse. Pulaski bore
this flag to victory through many battles until he fell mortally
wounded at Savannah, October 14, 1779. The banner was saved
by his first lieutenant, who received fourteen wounds, and delivered
it to Captain Bentalon, who on retiring from the army, took
it home to Baltimore. It was carried in the procession which
welcomed Lafayette in 1824, and was then deposited in the Peale
Museum. In 1844 Mr. Edmund Peale presented it to the Historical
Society of Maryland, where it is now preserved in a glass
case. These are interesting historical facts.</p>

<p>Flag of red and blue bars with serpent stretched across and
words, “Don’t Tread on Me.”</p>

<p>Another flag of white, with blue bands top and bottom and a
pine tree in center, with the inscriptions: Liberty Tree and An
Appeal to Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE “DON’T TREAD ON ME” FLAG.</h3>

<p>Another use of the rattlesnake was upon a ground of thirteen
horizontal bars alternate red and white, the snake extending
diagonally across the stripes, and the lower white stripes
bearing the motto—“Don’t Tread on Me.” The snake was
always represented as having thirteen rattles, and the number
thirteen seems constantly to have been kept in mind. Thus,
thirteen vessels are ordered to be built; thirteen stripes are
placed on the flag; in one design thirteen arrows are grasped
in a mailed hand; and in a later one thirteen arrows are in the
talons of an eagle.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER “DON’T TREAD ON ME” FLAG.</h3>

<p>One of the favorite flags also was of white with a pine tree
in the center. The words at the top were “An Appeal to God,”
and underneath the snake were the words, “Don’t Tread on Me.”
Several of the companies of minute men adopted a similar flag,
giving the name of their company with the motto “Liberty or
Death.” This flag is familiar to the public as the annual celebrations
bring out descriptions of it in the press.</p>


<h3>THE PRESIDENT’S FLAG.</h3>

<p>Within the last few years special flags have been designed for
the President, the Secretary of the Navy and Secretary of War.
The President’s flag is a very beautiful blue banner, in the center
of which is a spread eagle bearing the United States shield
on its breast, with the thirteen stars in a half circle overhead.
It is flown at the main mast-head of naval vessels while the
President remains on board, and on being hoisted it is the signal
for the firing of the President’s salute.</p>

<h2>COLONIAL AND PATRIOTIC MUSIC.</h2>


<p>The colonial music was mostly borrowed and adapted to the
occasion. The Pilgrims had more important duties to perform
and in those years of stirring events no one was in a mood to
write music.</p>

<p>The first song to be used was that old and familiar one,
“Yankee Doodle.” It made a powerful rallying cry in calling
to arms against England. It is so old that it is impossible
to decide just where the term came from.</p>

<p>It has been traced back to Greece—“Iankhe Doule,” meaning
“Rejoice, O Slave,” and to the Chinese—“Yong Kee,”
meaning “Flag of the Ocean.” It is said the Persians called
Americans “Yanki Doon’iah,” “Inhabitants of the New World.”
The Indians too, come in for their share of the credit of originating
the term, as the Cherokee word “Eankke,” which means
“coward” and “slave,” was often bestowed upon the inhabitants
of New England.</p>

<p>At the time of the uprising against Charles the First, Oliver
Cromwell rode into Oxford, on an insignificant little horse,
wearing a single plume in a knot called a “macaroni.” The
song was sung derisively by the cavaliers at that time. The
tune is said to have come from Spain or France, there being
several versions of the words.</p>

<p>It came into play when our ancestors flocked into Ticonderoga
in answer to the call of Abercrombie. At that early
day no one refused, but all answered the call and came equipped
as best they could, but hardly any two alike, and to the trained
English regulars must have presented a ridiculous appearance.
Dr. Shamburg changed the words of the old satire to fit the
new occasion. But in less than a year it was turned by the
Yankees against the English in the form of a rallying cry and
possessed new meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>History had emphasized it, and with the accompaniment of
the shrill pipe and half worn drum calling the simple cottagers
together, it must have aroused all their noble and sturdy patriotism.</p>

<p>Who that has viewed that stirring picture in the Corcoran
Art Gallery at Washington, “Yankee Doodle,” could fail to
catch the inspiration of the scene. The old man with his thin
grey locks, but head erect and face glowing with enthusiasm
as he keeps time to the old tune, followed by the small boy
with his drum. One scarcely knows whether humor or pathos
predominates: but certain we are that all alike stepped to its
chords; it found an answering echo in each heart and led them
on to glory.</p>

<h3>AMERICA.</h3>

<p>Rev. Samuel Francis Smith was born in Boston October 21,
1808, and graduated in the class of ’29 from Harvard University.
He enjoyed the honor of having for his classmate Oliver Wendell
Holmes, in whose beautiful poem, entitled “The Boys,”
the name of the author of “America” is affectionately mentioned.</p>

<h2>STARS ON THE FLAG.</h2>


<p>The Home Magazine contains the following beautiful suggestion
regarding the placing of the stars on the flag:</p>

<p>Number 1 is the field of our first stars and stripes made by
Betsy Ross.</p>

<p>Number 2 represents that field of flag of 1814 which inspired
the “Star Spangled Banner.”</p>

<p>Number 3 the field of 1818 designed by Capt. S. C. Reid.</p>

<p>Number 4, field of our present flag.</p>

<p>Although there is no law saying who shall arrange the stars
on our flag, or how they shall be arranged, it is customary for
the changes to be made in the war department when new states
have been admitted to the Union.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/i-036a.jpg" width="505" height="107" alt="flags 1-4 with stars" />
</div>

<p>The incongruous variations in figures A, B, C, which are
reproductions of unions taken from new flags, made by different
manufacturers, would not exist if there was a law fixing
the arrangement of the stars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 482px;">
<img src="images/i-036b.jpg" width="482" height="125" alt="flags a, b, c with stars" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>It is believed by many that the stars on our flag should be
arranged into a permanent and symmetrical form, fixed by law,
instead of the present changeable and uncertain form, which is
subject in a great measure, to the caprice or convenience of the
flag maker. It is not generally known that among the many
flags in use in our country to-day, there is an utter lack of uniformity
in the arrangement of the stars.</p>

<p>In the selection of a form, three different things should be
considered—its historical significance, symmetry, and adaptability.
The stars should be so arranged that it will not be necessary
to make any noticeable change when new ones are added.
The stars should always remain equal in size, representing the
equality of the states.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/i-037.jpg" width="194" height="165" alt="flag, star of Dav id made up of stars, surrounded by a circle of stars surrounded by a second more spaced circle of stars" />
</div>

<p>In the form which is submitted, No. 8, with the group of thirteen
stars in the center, representing the thirteen original states,
they are arranged in exactly the same form as they appear
on the great seal of the United States. The circle containing
twenty-three stars, represents the states which were admitted
to the Union up to the close of the civil war. These two features
are symbolic of the two great events in the nation’s history—the
one which brought our flag into existence, and the
other which made its life permanent by welding the sisterhood
of states into a perfect and indestructible union. The circle is
also symbolic of unity, peace, and preservation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The outside circle of nine stars, represents the states which
have been added to the Union since the civil war. New stars
can be added to this circle without changing the symmetry of
the arrangement, as will be seen by reference to the illustration.
As this circle will always remain an open one, there will
always be room for one more star, and it is thus significant
of progression.</p>

<p>One great advantage in this form is, that it is suggestive
of a constellation, and thus carries out, as far as practicable,
the idea of the framers of the resolution of 1777 in establishing
the flag.</p>

<p>John F. Earhart is the author of the above description of the
different forms of flags.</p>


<h3>THE LIBERTY CAP.</h3>

<p>The historians who have searched the archives of ancient
and medieval times tell us that this has been a symbol of liberty
since the Phrygians made the conquest of the eastern part of
Asia Minor.</p>

<p>After the conquest they stamped it on their coins, and to
distinguish themselves from the primitive peoples they used the
liberty cap as a head dress. The Romans used a small red cap
called a “pileus,” which they placed on the head of a slave in
making him free, and when Caesar was murdered a Phrygian
cap was carried through the streets of Rome proclaiming the
liberty of the people. The liberty cap of the English is blue
with a white border.</p>

<p>It remained for the United States to adopt the British cap,
adding to it the crescent of thirteen stars. Generals Lee and
Schuyler, with the Philadelphia Light Horse troop, adopted it
in 1775. This is the famous troop that escorted Washington
to New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>It is most familiar to us as seen on our coins, on which it
was first used after the Revolution as a symbol of freedom.</p>

<p>Edward Everett Hale, in one of his impressive orations,
says: “The starry banner speaks for itself; its mute eloquence
needs no aid to interpret its significance. Fidelity to the Union
blazes from its stars; allegiance to the government beneath which
we live is wrapped in its folds.”</p>

<p>The Stars and Stripes was officially first unfolded over Ft.
Schuyler, a military port in New York state, now the city of
Rome, Oneida county. It was first saluted on the sea by a
foreign power, when floating from the masthead of the Ranger,
Capt. Paul Jones commanding, at Quiberon Bay, France, February
14, 1778. The salute was given by Admiral La Motte,
representing the French government.</p>

<p>The first vessel over which the Union flag floated was the
ship Ranger, built at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, whose gallant
commander was the famous Paul Jones.</p>

<p>Its first trip around the world was on the ship Columbia,
which left Boston September 30, 1787, commanded by Captains
Kendrick and Gray. It was three years then in circling
the globe. To-day it waves in every clime, on every sea.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to note how Franklin, when minister to
France, secured the ship Doria from the French and gave to
Paul Jones the command, who immediately renamed the old
ship “Bon homme Richard,” in honor of Franklin.</p>


<h3>ORIGIN OF “OLD GLORY.”</h3>

<p>The term Old Glory is said to have been originated by an
old sailor—Stephen Driver.</p>

<p>While upon the seas he performed an act of bravery for
which he was rewarded by the gift of an American flag, whereupon
he pledged its givers to always defend it faithfully.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the civil war he was living in Nashville,
Tenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to keep the flag safely he concealed it in a bed-quilt
under which he slept. To the enemies of the Union he
declared that Old Glory would yet float from the staff of the
Tennessee state house, and sure enough when Nashville fell into
the hands of Gen. Buell he secured the flag from its hiding place
and hoisted it to a more fitting position on the state house—thus
his nick-name for it became popular.</p>


<h3>JOHN JAY AT MOUNT KISCO, JULY 4, 1861.</h3>

<p>He said, “Swear anew and teach the oath to our children,
that with God’s help the American Republic shall stand unmoved
though all the powers of piracy and European jealousy
should combine to overthrow it. That we shall have in the future
as we have had in the past, one country, one constitution,
one destiny; and that when we shall have passed from earth,
and the acts of to-day shall be matters of history, and the dark
power which sought our overthrow shall have been overthrown,
our sons may gather strength from our example in every contest
with despotism that time may have in store to try their
virtue, and that they may rally under the Stars and Stripes with
our old time war cry,</p>

<div class="center">“‘Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.’”</div>


<h3>UNCLE SAM.</h3>

<p>This term originated at the time of our war with England in
1812. Provisions were purchased at Troy, N. Y., and the agent
was Elbert Anderson, the work being superintended by Ebenezer
and Samuel Wilson, the packages being marked E. A.
U. S. Samuel Wilson was known all over as Uncle Sam and
he was often joked about his amount of provisions, then the
newspapers took it up and the term Uncle Sam came into
general use and is typical of our increasing national prosperity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Quite recently a portrait of an actual personage whose
features are identical with those made familiar by caricatures
of Uncle Sam, was found in possession of a family near Toledo,
Ohio. The portrait was painted about 1818, but nothing is
known of the shrewd, kindly old man represented. His face
was undoubtedly the origin of the accepted caricature.</p>


<h3>BROTHER JONATHAN.</h3>

<p>Jonathan Trumbull, governor of Connecticut, was a warm
friend of General Washington, who had great confidence in
his judgment.</p>

<p>When in need of ammunition and the question arose as to
where they could get the necessary means for defense Washington
said: “We will consult Brother Jonathan.”</p>

<p>After that whenever they needed help the expression became
a common one and naturally came to mean the United States
Government.</p>


<h3>THE AMERICAN EAGLE.</h3>

<p>Our bald headed eagle, so called because the feathers on
the top of the head are white, was named the Washington eagle
by Audubon. Like Washington it was brave and fearless, and
as his name and greatness is known the world over, so the
greatest of birds can soar to the heights beyond all others.</p>

<p>In 1785 it became the emblem of the United States.</p>

<p>It is used on the tips of flag staffs, on coins, on the United
States seals, and on the shield of liberty.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>




<h2>BANNERS AND STANDARDS.</h2>


<p>It is not generally known that the tassels which are pendent
customarily from the upper part of banners and standards,
and the fringe which surrounds them are relics of the practice
of observing sacred emblems. They originated in pagan devices
and the garments of priests and were consecrated to specific
forms of worship.</p>

<p>Sacred history is full of instances of the consecration of tassels
and peculiar fringes to special sacerdotal uses. Blue was
early the emblem of purity and innocence and that fact accounts
for the predominance of that color in the ecclesiastical
badges of these early times. When the use of the tassels passed
into profane customs, they were used as ornaments for national
standards and for royal girdles, and it was not infrequent that
they were first blessed by the priests. It has followed naturally
that this use has continued up to the present time, although
now it is retained probably because of the artistic effect of the
swinging pendants.</p>


<h3>THE LINCOLN FLAG.</h3>

<div class="center">Presented by the French People.</div>

<p>The flag in the White House which formerly hung in the
center of the largest window in the east room, has a unique
history.</p>

<p>It is woven of silk in one piece without a seam. There are
gold stars in the field and among them are seen the words in
French, “Popular subscription to the Republic of the United
States, offered in memory of Abraham Lincoln. Lyons, 1865.”</p>


<h3>STATE FLAGS.</h3>

<p>As the colonies had their flags of different kinds so the states
one by one adopted special flags and nearly all the states of
the Union now have a state flag or regimental color. In some
states this emblem is established by law, in other states by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
military department or the governor. There are a few states
in which this special flag is covered with particular devices
chosen by the caprice of the donor or the officials by whom the
flag was authorized, but in all these cases, the state arms form
a part of the emblazonment. There is a general feeling, however,
that these special states flags should have no legal recognition,
and that the only flag to be thus recognized should be
the Stars and Stripes.</p>


<h3>ORIGIN OF THE FLAG OF TRUCE.</h3>

<p>It is interesting to know how and why the little white flag
which is always looked upon with breathless interest in the
emergencies that call it forth, first came to be used.</p>

<p>When carried by the lone soldier on horse or on foot between
the armies it has a significance that is always respected,
and on the sea the hoisting of this flag at the ship’s mast or
the carrying of the flag of white by boat to the enemy stops
the firing of the guns. The custom originated in the church in
the tenth or eleventh century.</p>

<p>Curiously enough while it is the only flag that is to-day used
by all nations of the earth alike, no regularly made flag of
truce is found in the flag lockers of nations. It is improvised
when the emergency arises for its use. In the late war with
Spain, such flags of truce as were used were made of blankets,
sheets, table cloths. It is a flag that commands the enemy’s
respect. An account of the origin of the flag of truce
lately published, is as follows:</p>

<p>“La peace et la treve de Dieu” (The peace and the truce of
God) was an agreement between the turbulent barons and the
church, as severe injury and loss was most frequently the result
of the private warfares which constantly raged.</p>

<p>To protect itself, but more especially to preserve justice and
moral order, the church established a system which has exercised
a beneficent influence down to this day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The agreement stipulated a cessation of hostilities on certain
festivities and saint’s days, and from Saturday to Monday. The
barons and warrior class pledged during the time of war to
extend full protection to women, pilgrims, priests, monks, travelers,
merchants and agriculturists; to abstain from the destruction
or injury of farm implements, the burning of crops, and
the killing of live stock of the peasants. Penalties in violation
of this agreement comprised money fines, bafflings, banishment,
and excommunication.</p>

<p>Originating in the south of France this system was soon
adopted through the whole of France, Italy, Spain, Germany,
and England, and in 1095 Pope Urban II. proclaimed its universal
extension throughout Christendom.</p>

<p>In time the Crown assumed this protective power, and the
phrase was changed to “La paix et la treve du Roi,” or “The
peace and truce of the king.” The republics recognized the time-honored
institution, and the simple unfolding of a white cloth
will instantly cause a cessation of hostilities. The adoption of
a white emblem appears to be lost in tradition, as authorities
do not reveal it. Doubtless it is similar, or may have arisen
through a belief in the white Samite which shielded the Holy
Grail from the gaze of unbelievers. Emblematic of purity, associated
with the mythical knights of the Round Table, and
used in the Crusades, it is probable that this sacred truce flag
may have originated from the Samite of the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>At the present time, if presented during an engagement firing
is not required to cease; nor, if the bearer be killed or
wounded, is there ground for complaint. The truce emblem can
be retained if admitted, during an engagement. Penalties are
incurred if the truce emblem be wrongfully used, the severest
being the ignominious death of a spy.</p>

<h2>SKETCH OF BETSY ROSS AND HER HUSBANDS.</h2>

<p>Elizabeth Griscom, a daughter of Samuel and Rebecka
(James) Griscom of Philadelphia, was born January 1, 1752.
They were “Friends” and the young Elizabeth grew into a
most charming, bright and beautiful girl of prepossessing manners
and plain and quiet tastes.</p>

<p>Her father was a noted builder and assisted in the erection
of the state house, now Independence Hall. His house, shop
and a very large garden were on Arch street, between 3d and
4th streets.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, or Betsy, as she was fondly called, was the seventh
daughter. Her birthday was the first day under the new
Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>It was frequently said by the family that “she was born the
first day of the month, the first day of the year, the first
day of the new style.” She was well trained by her mother, became
very expert with her needle and was very fond of embroidery.</p>

<p>Among her many admirers was John Ross, son of Æneas
Ross, assistant rector of Christ Episcopal Church. The young
man was a nephew of the Hon. George Ross, delegate to Congress,
one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>In December, 1773, at the age of twenty-one years, Elizabeth
married John Ross, an estimable young man. He was an
Episcopalian, and in consequence of her marrying out of meeting,
she was disowned by the Friends.</p>

<p>The first husband of Betsy Ross was of distinguished ancestry.
The Hon. George Ross, of New Castle, Delaware, had by his
first wife, two sons: John, who died May 5th, 1776; and Rev.
Æneas, born Sept. 9th. 1716, who was father of John Ross (husband
of Betsy Ross).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>By his second wife he had Hon. George Ross, signer of Declaration
of Independence, born 1730, died 1780; also one daughter,
Gertrude, who married George Read, also a signer of the
Declaration of Independence; also a son, Jacob, a physician.</p>

<p>The Hon. George Ross was a noted lawyer, and a resident
of Lancaster. He was a brave soldier and a man of ability.</p>

<p>John Ross was an apprentice with a man named Webster,
an upholsterer on Chestnut street. It was with him that John and
afterwards Betsy, learned the trade before they “ran off” to
be married.</p>

<p>They then set up business for themselves, first on Chestnut
street and afterwards moved to the little house on Arch street,
which was a simple building when first occupied by them. It
was built some time after 1752, notwithstanding romantic stories
to the contrary. The first room was utilized as a shop; the store
front not having been added until about 1858.</p>

<p>It was in this house that the flag was made later on.</p>

<p>In 1775 John Ross was injured while guarding military stores
on the wharf, from the effects of which he died at this house
in January, 1776. He was buried in Christ Churchyard, 5th
and Arch streets. He left no children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ross continued the upholstery business and the manufacture
of flags.</p>

<p>Betsy Ross married for her second husband, at Old Swedes
Church, Philadelphia, Captain Joseph Ashburn, June 15, 1777,
and to them were born two daughters:</p>

<p>Jillah, born September 15th, 1779. Died young.</p>

<p>Eliza, born February 25th, 1781. Who married Capt. Isaack
Silliman, May 29th, 1799. After Capt. Silliman’s death in the
army, his wife Eliza lived with her mother, Betsy Ross, until
her death in 1836.</p>

<p>To them were born four children:</p>

<p>Joseph Ashburn; Emilia; Jane; Willys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Emilia left one daughter, Mrs. Mary Sidney Garrett, a widow
and childless. She is the only living descendant of the second
marriage.</p>

<p>Joseph Ashburn was taken prisoner by the British on the
sea, and with the other soldiers was taken to England where
he died in Mill Prison, March 3d, 1782. The prisoners were all
given an opportunity to enter the British service, and on their
refusal were thrown into prison. John Claypoole, a comrade,
and also a prisoner of war, nursed and cared for Ashburn until
he died. He brought home to his widow, on his release, the
diary of Ashburn, together with messages to his wife, with
whom he fell in love and afterward married.</p>

<p>John Claypoole, son of William and Elizabeth Claypoole, of
Philadelphia, was married to Elizabeth Ashburn (Betsy Ross)
the 8th of May, 1783, at Christ Church. His ancestor was James
Claypoole, who came to America as the friend of William Penn;
and from whom all the Claypooles mentioned are descended.
He was a brother of Sir John Claypoole, who married Elizabeth,
daughter of Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>The children of John and Elizabeth Claypoole were: Clarissa
Sidney, born April 3, 1785, 9 a. m.; Susanna, born November
15, 1786, 4 p. m.; Rachel, born February 1, 1789, 7 p. m.;
Jane, born November 13, 1793, 7 p. m.; Harriet, born December
20, 1795, 5 a. m., died October 8, 1796.</p>

<p>There is an old Bible over a hundred years old, which has
a record of all these births and those of the Ashburn daughters;
and of the deaths in the handwriting of John Claypoole. It
was “The legacy of Sarah Hallowell to her niece, Elizabeth Claypoole,”
that is, Betsy Ross.</p>

<p>John Claypoole was wounded in the battle of Germantown
which, with imprisonment and the hardships of war, so impaired
his health that he never regained it. So it may be truthfully
said that the lives of her three husbands were sacrificed to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
country, and her experience in these very important events in
her life is certainly heroic. John Claypoole died August 3,
1817.</p>

<p>Betsy Ross attended Christ Church, Philadelphia, with her
first husband and after his death continued in attendance until
the Free Quaker Society was organized in 1793. The pew in
which she sat was quite near one occupied by Gen. Washington,
and is marked by a brass plate bearing these words:</p>

<p>“In this pew worshipped Betsey Ross, who made the first
flag.”</p>

<p>All Friends who took part in the Revolution were disowned
by “The Society of Friends.” After the war, they organized a
society of “Free Quakers” often called “Fighting Quakers.”</p>

<p>As the time went by, nearly all were taken back into the
original “Society of Friends,” but Clarissa Wilson and John
Price Wetherell, of Philadelphia, were the last of the Free Quakers.
They used to attend the little meeting house at 5th and
Arch streets until there were just the two of them. In the fall
of 1830 they decided it was unwise to have the little meeting
house heated for them, so after that Clarissa Wilson attended
the Orange street meeting house, but was never again received
into the original society. She did not wish to be. She died a
Free Quaker. Betsy Ross, her mother, lived to be 84 years
old and died in 1836. The following are from the original autographs
of Betsy Ross and her husband:</p>

<h2>THE OLD KEY MANSION.</h2>


<p>The old Key mansion is one of the historic places that still
remains on the banks of the Potomac in Georgetown, to remind
us that here lived Francis Scott Key, the author of the national
hymn “The Star Spangled Banner.” In unveiling to him the
monument which had been erected at Fredericksburg, Maryland,
during the past summer (1898), the Hon. Murat Halsted paid
an eloquent tribute to this poet, who crystallized the best thought
of the American people in giving to them “The Star Spangled
Banner.” “O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave,”
this flag still waves. Freedom to-day has a broader meaning
than in the days of 1814. Slavery has been abolished and freedom
has spread her wings o’er all the land. The history of the
writing of this beautiful song can be told in a few words. It
was an inspiration. The British had captured a friend of Francis
Scott Key, Dr. Beans, and when Key heard of it, he called
upon President Madison, who furnished him with a vessel to
go to the British Admiral Cockburn’s ship, to endeavor to secure
his release. General Ross, of the British army, agreed to
release him, but insisted upon Key’s remaining on the admiral’s
ship until after the bombardment of Fort McHenry, which was
then taking place. Key was intensely anxious and in the early
morning, he looked across to the fort and saw that “the flag
was still there.” It is said that he then wrote a sketch of the
“Star Spangled Banner” on the back of a letter. The burning
of the capitol and of the White House a few days previous
by them are well known matters of history. A few days after,
the British fleet sailed for Baltimore, where they were gallantly
repulsed with the loss of their commander, General Ross.
The fleet in passing Mount Vernon, lowered their flags out of
respect to the memory of the immortal Washington, whose remains
are here entombed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Key was born in Frederick county, Maryland, August 1,
1779. He graduated at St. John’s College, Annapolis, Maryland.</p>

<h3>BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC.</h3>

<p>This beautiful song, which is set to the tune of “John Brown,”
was written by Julia Ward Howe in 1861 just after her escape
from a rebel raid when witnessing, with friends, a review of
troops near Washington. In her dreams she was inspired by the
beautiful thoughts and she immediately arose, and hastily noted
them down.</p>

<p>It is considered one of the grandest battle hymns of the Republic
and has been a favorite with several of our presidents.</p>

<h3>THE BON HOMME RICHARD FLAG.</h3>

<p>This historic old flag, also known as the Paul Jones Flag,
composed of thirteen bars and but twelve stars, was unfurled
by him and borne on the Bon Homme Richard September 23,
1776, during the action with the British frigate, the “Serapis,”
and is probably the first flag bearing the stars and stripes ever
hoisted over an American vessel of war, and also the first ever
saluted by a foreign naval power.</p>

<p>This flag has been in the family of Mrs. H. R. P. Stafford,
of Cottage City, Martha’s Vineyard, since 1784, and bequeathed
by her to the National Museum at Washington.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that Washington adopted the
flag made by Betsy Ross five months previous to this.</p>


<h3>“THE OLD THIRTEEN.”<br />

A Leaf from Illinois’ History.</h3>

<p>In the little city of Shawneetown which is next in age to
Kaskaskia, and consequently the second oldest town in the State,
there reposes a relic of rare value, a genuine flag of Colonial
days. It was found in the attic of the “Posey” building and is
supposed to have been placed there by General Posey, who
served under Washington in the Revolutionary war. The flag
is now owned by Mr. Robinson, an eminent scientist, who for
a life-time has taken pains to collect and preserve many valuable
things for Illinois’ posterity to see, especially rare Indian
curios excavated from in and around Shawneetown, which site
was once the pottery of the Shawanee Indians.</p>

<p>The old flag is in rather a good state of preservation although
faded and marred. Its thirteen stars are arranged similar to
those on “Paul Jones’ flag”—in bars, but not horizontal. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
rows of stars are placed diagonally and consist of one, three,
five, three and one, which leaves a star in each corner and five
forming the center diagonal. Illinois’ “Old Thirteen” has been
framed and covered with glass to preserve it from the ravages of
Time and to save it for the eyes of the children of coming generations.</p>

<h3>HAIL COLUMBIA.</h3>

<p>This was written by Hon. Joseph Hopkinson, of Philadelphia,
at the request of a young friend—a theatrical singer whose appeal
was for a patriotic song suitable for the times. England
and France were quarreling and this country was necessarily
a good deal agitated.</p>

<p>It was set to the music called The President’s March, which
was composed by Philip Roth, a German, for Gen. Washington’s
inauguration in the City Hall in New York. A great
many people were for standing by our ally, France, but Gen.
Washington insisted on strict neutrality; thus the song was requited
to voice this sentiment. It appealed at once to both parties
and charmed every one who heard it—was sung night after
night, audiences joining in the chorus.</p>

<h2>TERRITORIAL EXPANSION.</h2>


<p>Washington took the oath of office as first President of the
United States on the steps of Federal Hall in Wall street, New
York city, April 30, 1789, and for a short time the seat of government
was here before being changed to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The history of how Alexander Hamilton, the great Secretary
of the Treasury under Washington, made the trade with Jefferson
whereby the present site of the capital was selected is interesting,
as showing that Hamilton, while constructing a powerful
centralized government with skill and ability, as even Jefferson’s
biographer admits, cared little about the location of
the capital itself. The Southern States wanted it on the Potomac;
the Middle and Eastern States wished it to be further
north. Hamilton wanted the government to assume the State
debts, brought about by the war. Jefferson and his party were
opposed to it. Hamilton finally secured the support of Jefferson
and his friends in Congress in support of the assumption,
while he delivered to the Jefferson party the location of the
capital at Washington. In after years this was a source of great
discomfort to Jefferson, he claiming to have been duped by
Hamilton.</p>



<h3>ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY.</h3>


<h4>LOUISIANA.</h4>

<p>In 1800 Napoleon forced Spain to cede Louisiana back to
France, after thirty-seven years of ownership. The idea of LaSalle,
who had looked forward to establishing here a new France,
was long since forgotten, but Napoleon, now in the zenith of
his power, formed the brilliant plan of colonizing this great
country from the Mississippi to the Rockies and from the Gulf
to the British possessions in the North, thereby hemming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the United States. Napoleon tried to subdue the Island of
San Domingo, with the idea of using it as an outside base of
supplies, but his troops were terribly slaughtered by the natives,
and the army that he intended to send to Louisiana never came.
About this time Napoleon was busy looking after England, and
as after events proved needed all of his troops at home. He
succeeded, however, in creating great alarm in America. The
settlers west of the Alleghenies were especially disturbed. The
Mississippi was practically closed for navigation, as the Spaniards,
who held possession of New Orleans, would not allow
them to bring their products down the river and reship, as had
long been the custom.</p>

<p>President Jefferson appointed James Monroe and Livingston,
then our minister at Paris, to call on Napoleon, and, if possible,
purchase West Florida and New Orleans, the amount
to be paid not to exceed $3,000,000.</p>

<p>Napoleon was very much in need of money to conduct his
war against England, and his disastrous attempt to subdue the
natives of San Domingo probably made him decide to offer
the whole of Louisiana, which he did for $15,000,000. This
great purchase was consummated by Monroe in 1803. This
was the greatest act of Jefferson’s administration, but the people
bitterly opposed it, claiming that we had no use for the additional
territory. Napoleon said that in selling Louisiana to
the United States “he had placed a thorn where England would
some day feel it.” The acquisition of Louisiana more than
doubled the area of the United States, which was 827,844 square
miles, increasing it to 1,999,775 square miles. It constitutes
about ten of our largest States to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h4>FLORIDA.</h4>

<p>This State, with all its old traditions, has seen many vicissitudes.
It belonged to Spain from 1565 until 1763, nearly two
hundred years, when Great Britain traded Cuba for it. In
1781, the British were expelled by Spain and that country again
assumed possession of Florida. In a very few years the inability
which Spain has ever shown to properly govern her Colonial
possessions was manifest. A war broke out between the
Spaniards and the Seminole Indians of Florida and soon the
whole State was in a condition of virtual anarchy. Emboldened
by their successes in warfare, the Indians molested the frontier
of Georgia. The Government of the United States then
took an action which constituted a precedent for its action in
invading Cuba in the late war with Spain. It despatched a military
force into Florida under command of General Andrew
Jackson. He virtually took possession of Florida and speedily
restored order. His conduct excited much debate in Congress
and in the Cabinet, a strong anti-expansion sentiment developing.
The matter was finally settled by purchasing Florida from
Spain for $5,000,000. This was done in 1819. Emigration
poured into the territory from the States further north and soon
the value of Florida as an acquisition to the country became evident
and the anti-expansion sentiment died away. In 1845
Florida was admitted into the Union as a State. In 1861 it
seceded with other Southern States and returned again to the
Union in 1868.</p>

<p>It may be pertinent right here to say that when the United
States buys or comes into possession of a tract of land it becomes
the property of the country and is called a Territory,
and under the Constitution it is so treated, without representation
in Congress until such time as it is admitted into the Union
and becomes one of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>


<h4>TEXAS.</h4>

<p>This great Territory comprising 370,472 square miles originally
belonged to Mexico. In 1820 Moses Austin, a native
of Connecticut, obtained a grant of land and threw it open to
settlement by people from the United States, mostly the Southern
States. In a few years more than 20,000 had settled there
and the strong Anglo-Saxon spirit of liberty began to rebel
against the oppressive Mexican rule. In a few years this feeling
burst into an open revolt. Texans met and declared their
independence and formed a Republic and placed an army in
the field under Gen. Sam. Houston. He met the Mexicans under
Gen. Santa Anna at San Jacinto in 1836 and gained a complete
victory, thus achieving the independence of Texas. Next
year Texas applied for admission into the Union but no action
was taken by Congress for several years. Meantime in the north
a strong sentiment had developed against the institution of slavery.
The subject was vigorously agitated in the pulpit, in literature
and in public. The Southern people, perceiving the
strength of the opposition to their favorite institution, determined
in self defense to acquire more territory for the sake of
the strength additional votes would give them, and so in 1844
the proposal to admit Texas came up in Congress in earnest.</p>

<p>No concealment of the underlying purpose was made by
the Southern Congressmen who led the movement. A bitter
struggle followed but the annexationists prevailed and in 1845
the “Lone Star State,” as Texas had been called, was added
to the Union. The South welcomed the new comer with great
demonstrations, but the greetings of the North were not cordial,
for in that section it was clearly understood that a great
extension was given to slave territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>


<h4>NEW MEXICO AND ARIZONA.</h4>

<p>The vast territory included in these two Territories was acquired
mostly from Mexico in 1848 as one of the terms of the
treaty of peace between the United States and that country made
after the war of 1846-47. The war with Mexico was brought
about by the refusal of the Mexican Government to concede the
claims of Texas to land between the Rio Grande and the Nueces
Rivers. The actual rights in the case were somewhat obscure,
but war was eagerly undertaken by the Southern people, who
believed that a further extension of slave territory would be the
ultimate result. The North was less enthusiastic, for this reason,
but sent a quota of troops into the field before whose valor,
directed by commanding officers who later became prominent
in the great war of the Rebellion, the Mexican armies were
defeated. The United States paid Mexico $15,000,000 for the
territory ceded under the treaty and in addition paid $3,500,000
in settlement of the claims of private individuals. The boundary
line remained in dispute for five years more, until 1853,
when James Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexico settling
all questions. Under its terms the United States gained the
Mesilla Valley, forming the southern part of what is now New
Mexico and Arizona, and comprising 20,000,000 acres. The
United States paid Mexico $10,000,000 for this land which was
afterwards known as the Gadsden purchase and is so marked
on the larger maps issued by the Interior Department at Washington.
Including the territory acquired by the Mexican war,
the State of Texas and that included in the Gadsden purchase,
the whole area is sufficient to make one hundred and seventy
States the size of Connecticut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h4>CALIFORNIA.</h4>

<p>This great State was ceded to us by Mexico, being part of
that country before the war. In 1848 gold was discovered by
Capt. Sutter in a river near Sacramento. On examination gold
was found to occur in abundance. News of the wonderful
discovery drew an immense emigration into California from
all parts of the world, the majority of those traveling across
the plains by the way of the Isthmus of Panama being, of course,
from the United States. The people who poured into the golden
State lost no time in applying for admission into the Union.
In 1849, one year after Sutter’s discovery, the State presented
itself at the door of Congress. In 1850 California was admitted.
The celerity of the operation was due to the fact the North
recognized, that California would offset to an extent the growth
of slave territory actually made by the admission of Texas and
threatened in Arizona and New Mexico, areas peculiarly adapted
by climate and other conditions to the institution of slavery.</p>

<p>Oregon, Washington and Idaho were part of what was called
the great Oregon country. They were acquired under an agreement
with Great Britain in 1846. The United States claimed
the territory up to the parallel of 54° 49′, but a compromise
was made and the 49th parallel accepted as the dividing line
between the United States and the British possessions. The
country north of the line is now known as British Columbia.</p>


<h4>ALASKA.</h4>

<p>Alaska, whose area is equal to about 120 States the size of
Connecticut, became the property of the United States in 1867
by purchase from Russia. The sum paid for it was $7,000,000.
The purchase, negotiated by Secretary of State Seward, was denounced
by many as an extravagant use of public funds because
Alaska appeared to be practically worthless. The Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
however, unheeding the kind of criticism paid $200,000
in addition to the first price named to extinguish the rights of
various commercial companies and thus acquired a clear title.
It was soon found the supposed ice bound land was full of
wealth in fisheries and lumber, the income from seal fisheries
alone amounting in one year to $2,500,000. Alaska’s wealth in
gold was, however, not suspected until recent years and not
demonstrated until the summer of 1896, when the now famous
treasure ship arrived in San Francisco having on board over
$600,000 in gold, the property of 50 prospectors who had washed
it out of the bars of the creeks emptying into the Yukon river.
Alaska, the “ice bound, inhospitable desert of the north,” as
it was designated in 1868, was a Mecca for the world for the
next few months and thousands braved the dangers of Chilkoot
pass to search for the yellow metal, and at this time it is
estimated over 50,000 people are in that part of the Territory
which two years ago was practically uninhabited.</p>


<h4>GENERAL GRANT ON EXPANSION.</h4>

<p>President Grant in his second inaugural address, March 4,
1873, thus expressed himself: “I do not share in the apprehension
held by many as to the danger of governments becoming
weakened and destroyed by reason of their extension of territory.
Commerce, education and rapid transit of thought and
matter by telegraph and steam have changed all this. Rather,
I believe that our Great Maker is preparing the world, in his
own good way to become one nation, speaking one language,
and when armies and navies will no longer be required.”</p>


<h4>HAWAII, CUBA, PORTO RICO, AND THE PHILIPPINES.</h4>

<p>These great and interesting acquisitions to our territory have
not yet entered the blue field of our flag. To a great nation
and to a humane people they will look for that protection which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
has been pledged to them; and if it is decided that these people
shall live under our starry flag, no one can look back over its
history and doubt the strength and breadth of its folds.</p>


<h4>THE SOCIETY OF THE CINCINNATI.</h4>

<p>This historic and patriotic order was named after the famous
Roman Dictator and Patriot, Cincinnatus, and was founded in
May, 1783, on the banks of the Hudson, by the American and
French officers who had gathered there at the close of the Revolutionary
war.</p>

<p>The resolution adopted at the forming of the society contained
these words: “To perpetuate, therefore, as well the remembrance
of this vast event as the mutual friendships which
have been formed, of common danger, and, in many instances,
cemented by the blood of the parties, the officers of the American
Army do hereby, in the most solemn manner, associate,
constitute and combine themselves into one society of friends
to endure as long as they shall endure, or any of their eldest
male posterity, and in failure thereof the collateral branches who
may be judged worthy of becoming its supporters and defenders.”</p>

<p>Owing to the great distances between the different States,
and the fact that at that time the means of transportation were
slow and uncertain, it was deemed best to form societies in
each of the thirteen States. This was done. One was also
organized in France under the patronage of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>The original members included the names of Washington,
Greene, Hamilton, Lafayette, Rochambeau, and Paul Jones;
in fact, all the historic military and naval characters of the Revolution.
Among the honorary members elected for their own
lives only were the names of many signers of the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p>On the pages of the country’s history appears no darker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
spot than that placed there by the Congress of the United States
in its failure to give its soldiers the promised half pay for their
services, forcing them to leave their homes and emigrate to
the wild lands west of the Alleghenies, which were given to
them in lieu of money. On this account several of the orders
in the different States went out of existence.</p>

<p>The patriotic societies of the country, the names of which
are given here, were all formed for the purpose of perpetuating
the memory of events and of the men who in military, naval
and civil positions of high trust and responsibility, “kept step
to the music of the Union.”</p>

<p>The preservation of historical records and manuscripts and
the promoting of fraternal intercourse among their members are
the main inspirations of all of these patriotic societies:</p>

<p>Society of Colonial Wars.</p>

<p>Sons of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.</p>

<p>Grand Army of the Republic.</p>

<p>Sons of Veterans U. S. A.</p>

<p>There are three great patriotic societies, organized by the
women of America, known as the Daughters of the Revolution,
Colonial Dames, and the Mayflower, that may outstrip all other
societies in the value and importance of their work.</p>

<h2>SAVE THE OLD FLAG HOUSE.<br />



<small>THE HOME OF BETSY ROSS.</small></h2>

<p>The objects of the American Flag House and Betsy Ross Memorial
Association are to purchase and preserve the historic building, situated
at No. 239 Arch Street, Philadelphia, Pa., in which the first flag of the
United States of America was made by Betsy Ross and subsequently
adopted by Congress, June 14th, 1777, and to erect a national memorial in
honor of this illustrious woman.</p>

<p>All loyal American hearts will welcome the glad tidings that active
steps have been taken to purchase the birthplace of the Star Spangled
Banner, and under the auspices of the American Flag House and Betsy
Ross Memorial Association shall henceforth be preserved as a lasting
tribute to those whose heroism resulted in establishing that freedom
which a united people are to-day enjoying.</p>

<p>Appreciating the importance of preserving this relic of the Revolution,
a number of patriotic gentlemen of this and other States have taken
the matter in hand, thus making the movement national in its scope.</p>

<p>Numerous attempts have been made in the past to remove this historic
building to other cities. The present plans provide that it shall
remain in Philadelphia, where it rightfully belongs, there to be held in
trust for the nation.</p>

<p>It has been left to the option of the American people whether the
birthplace of their national emblem shall be permitted to pass into oblivion.</p>

<p>This landmark should be the mecca and shrine of the whole nation.
It was associated with one of the most memorable incidents of our early
history, and it is most fitting that it should be preserved for future generations.</p>

<p>Like “Independence Hall,” wherein the Declaration of Independence
was signed, and Faneuil Hall, the cradle of liberty, it speaks most eloquently
of the men and women to whom we owe our freedom.</p>

<p>While we honor the heroes of the past, let us not forget to preserve
the mementoes associated with them. Such relics increase in value as
they are transmitted from one generation to another and form object lessons
in history.</p>

<p>To follow our flag from its birth until to-day would be to write a
history which stands absolutely alone, and from the day of its creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the present time it has never trailed in the dust, being the only exception
among the flags of the world. It is not that we have not been
called upon to defend it and the underlying principles for which it stands,
for to-day as we celebrate the anniversaries of victories on land and sea
we cannot but recall, with mingled pride and pleasure, the achievements
won under its glorious folds, and when our patriots, inspired by a God-like
devotion to flag and country, performed deeds of daring that mark
their efforts as the most signal ever accomplished under any flag by any
heroes of any nation.</p>

<p>With all these glorious deeds, and others that must necessarily follow,
let us as a grateful, patriotic people see to it that the birthplace of our
nation’s flag be preserved as a holy shrine.</p>

<p>With the view of making the movement a popular one, arrangements
have been made to have all Americans, of every shade of religious and
political opinion, affiliate alike, and by their participation to become the
preservers of the birthplace of the “Stars and Stripes.”</p>

<p>On these broad principles souvenir certificates of membership in this
Association will be issued at a nominal price, and the names of all subscribers
placed on the roll of honor.</p>

<p>Any person desiring to see the Old Flag House saved and Betsy
Ross honored may become a member of the “American Flag House and
Betsy Ross Memorial Association” upon the payment of 10 cents, for
which they will receive a beautiful certificate of membership, size 11x14,
duly signed by the officers of the Association, and bearing the seal and
certificate number. Upon these certificates in the centre is artistically
portrayed the room in which Betsy Ross displayed the first Stars and
Stripes to the committee appointed by Congress, consisting of General
Washington, Robert Morris and Hon. George Ross. On the left is an
exterior picture of the Old Flag House as it stands to-day, while on the
right is the picture of the grave of Betsy Ross, at Mt. Moriah Cemetery.</p>

<p>These certificates will be mailed to any address upon the receipt
of 10c.</p>




<h2>NOTICE.</h2>


<p>A large reproduction, in ten colors, size 22x28 inches, of the original
painting, “Birth of Our Nation’s Flag,” by Charles H. Weisgerber, first
exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893, will be
presented as a souvenir to any person forming a club of thirty members,
inclusive. These premium pictures will not be for sale, and when the
objects of the Association are attained the plates will be destroyed: thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
they will become a valuable family heirloom. For upon them will be
engrossed the name of the individual forming the club, as follows:<br /><br /></p>



<p>“Presented to ...................... of ................................
by the American Flag House and Betsy Ross Memorial Association, for
aiding in the preservation of the Birthplace of our Nation’s Flag, and
for the erection of a National Memorial in Honor of Betsy Ross, and
stamped with the seal of the Association.”<br /><br /></p>

<p>The picture referred to above is an exact representation of the room
in which the first American Flag was made by Betsy Ross, which was
subsequently adopted by Congress, June 14, 1777, and is the only endorsed
portrait representation of Betsy Ross by her living descendants.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
